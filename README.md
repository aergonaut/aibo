# Aibo

Aibo is your partner in crime. Deploy Aibo and he'll keep track of your open
Pull Requests and nudge them along to completion.

Aibo works best with workflows that use Pull Request comments to kick off
processes in external systems. For example, if you have a Jenkins system
listening for key phrases to start new test runs. You just need to tell Aibo
which status checks could potentially be fixed by posting a comment, and Aibo
will post those comments for you if any of the statuses are failing.
